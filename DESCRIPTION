Description: Produces an economic evaluation of a sample of suitable variables of
             cost and effectiveness / utility for two or more interventions,
             e.g. from a Bayesian model in the form of MCMC simulations.
             This package computes the most cost-effective alternative and
             produces graphical summaries and probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
